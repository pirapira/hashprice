block reward 50->25 happened at 2012-11-28


ところで、そもそも何となにを比べるべきであろうか。

So what.
- difficulty: https://blockchain.info/q/getdifficulty
- reward: should be calculatable from the height.  see reward.hs
- fee: blockchain.info/rawblock
- usdbtc: https://blockchain.info/ticker gives the price.

So.  These are the things.
What do we do?

I would cache these values for 5 minutes or something.
Actually, the cache can be just on memory.
Or, on disk is possible.
Maybe later I want to draw a graph or something.
Then, on disk is preferrable.

What would be the types?
for blocks and for tickers.
But now, it might be good to work on the code itself.
